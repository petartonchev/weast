3505;   For media firms  content is king  As more and more content producers migrate their content to other platforms   NFLX will struggle to replenish its content library  especially as licensing the most desirable series and IP becomes increasingly costly  ;1;575
3506;   Comparative advantages are critically important to firms operating in a competitive environment  However  not all advantages are created equal  In the case of  NFLX  its considerable lead in platform tech may not be worth much in the scheme of things  ;1;0.4

3596;We expect the company to underperform near term forecasts for subscriber growth and earnings with overall risks tilted to the downside   NFLX;0;0.2
3597;Recognizing Netflix as a solid brand with some continued momentum worldwide  the concern here comes down to valuation as it becomes harder to justify its growth premium amid weaker trends and higher uncertainty   NFLX;-1;0.22222222222222224
3598;Takeaway We are bearish on Netflix and see this latest rally from a low of under      per share as a new opportunity to sell or take a short exposure   NFLX;0;0.48863636363636365
3599;Right now  beyond an intensive slate of original programming premiers on the streaming service  Netflix appears content on simply betting on more of the same   NFLX;1;0.45357142857142857
3600;Control of a movie theater property also provides an outlet to feature key programming on a big screen format which could be positive for margins and growth potential   NFLX;1;0.6613636363636364
3601;Separately  the possibility of an acquisition of a movie theater chain like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc  AMC   while unlikely at this point  could provide Netflix with some interesting bundling options between streaming and movie theater tickets as a subscription   NFLX;1;0.5

3603;the new entrant represents a headwind for subscriber growth this quarter    NFLX;1;0.45454545454545453
3604;In the near term  we see this current Q  as representing a difficult operating environment for Netflix which faces the launch of Disney  in multiple markets around the world and there s a thought that at least at the margin   NFLX;-1;0.44000000000000006
3605;Since we are more skeptical on the upside of the company s  pricing power  within the competitive landscape  the result is an effective ceiling on average revenue per user  ARPU    NFLX;1;0.55
3606;Again  the company revenue growth is a function of both subscriber additions which are being driven by the international market and Netflix s ability to regularly hike the monthly subscription rate   NFLX;1;0.038461538461538464
3607;Beyond our view that there s a high chance Netflix will miss these targets and the estimates face the risk of revisions lower  we believe the current valuation multiples are simply too aggressive given the higher uncertainty for long term forecasts   NFLX;0;0.4394285714285714
3608;The earnings numbers here imply a   year forward P E of   x on      consensus EPS and   x on the   year forward      estimate   NFLX;0;0.0
3609;Trends in Valuation Taking a look at the current market consensus earnings  the expectation is for Netflix EPS to accelerate from       posted in      to       this year and       by fiscal year        NFLX;0;0.4
3610;A wave of users in material numbers hopping between streaming services in different periods of the year would represent earnings pressure for Netflix   NFLX;-1;0.6
3611;The current relative ease of cancelling Netflix and restarting the monthly subscription facilitates the option which could intensify this churn Netflix management alluded to and result in higher quarterly revenue volatility going forward   NFLX;1;0.3
3612;This draws parallels to the experience food service delivery company GrubHub Inc  NYSE GRUB  which blamed its Q  earnings miss on customers jumping around different services   NFLX;0;0.6
3613;The risk we see for Netflix into      is a new dynamic where consumers increasingly jump between streaming providers over different periods to take advantage of series launches while binge watching other content on a month to month basis   NFLX;1;0.3990530303030303
3614;Either consumers with the financial means have Netflix currently or are simply not interested   NFLX;1;0.3
3615;While it s recognized that the growth is from developing international markets  we expect a convergence toward domestic market penetration levels sooner than later suggesting the high growth phase is ending   NFLX;1;0.15999999999999998
3616;It s hard to imagine why at this point a certain new original series or movie launch will be enough to convince  holdouts  from signing up   NFLX;1;0.5635281385281385

3810; AlmingtonCap  tedstein  Trumpery    JacksonStewal I don t buy that  Evidence doesn t support it  So being worried about its ability to reach cash flow positive is reasonable  but there is good evidence that other pieces are on the board in  NFLX s favor;1;0.5301136363636364
3811; AlmingtonCap  tedstein  Trumpery    JacksonStewal    My hang up is that focusing on  NFLX s spend and debt alone  which IS justified  is too narrow a lens for me here  misses that it has built an engine for driving streaming views targeted to customers it knows REALLY well  If there a bear case to be made  it s not a binary one;1;0.5
3812; AlmingtonCap  tedstein  Trumpery    JacksonStewal     NFLX is burning through cash and raising billions in debt to fund this model for this outcome  Disney  is about to take a similar path in terms of pursuing a loss leader  but at a smaller scale in pure dollar amounts  but also at smaller scale w  tech  marketing  amp  audience;-1;475

3845; aagave  fmuccari  HedgeyeComm  SwanniOnTV  EntStrategyGuy  MasterPhoFooga  Again  a short thesis does not necessitate bankruptcy  only a reversion to rational pricing  Such will be the case with  NFLX  You just admitted as much  QED ;1;0.5

3848; aagave  fmuccari  HedgeyeComm  SwanniOnTV  EntStrategyGuy  MasterPhoFooga  Your  thesis  consists of   P   Only  NFLX has built a top tier UX streaming platform  dubious in light of ever improving Hulu et al    P   As no co  has built a comparable platform  none can or ever will   C  Therefore  NFLX is unassailable   That ain t logic  That s just silly ;1;0.76875
